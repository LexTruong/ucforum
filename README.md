UC FORUM is a space for all students and faculty in the
University of California school system to openly and freely
discuss politics, education, or anything else. Users can 
share their opinions by writing and posting articles. They
can also comment on, like, or dislike other users' articles,
allowing the article author to get a feel for public opinion.
UC FORUM seeks to foster healthy democratic debate with
an uncensored, diversity of ideas.
